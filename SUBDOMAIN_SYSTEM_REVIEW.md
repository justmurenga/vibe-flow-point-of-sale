# Subdomain System Review & Fixes

## âœ… Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Missing Routes in Subdomain Configuration**
**Problem**: Subdomain routing was missing several important tenant admin routes
**Fixed**: Updated `src/App.tsx` subdomain routing to include all necessary routes:
- `/admin/stock` - Stock management
- `/admin/purchases` - Purchase management  
- `/admin/accounting` - Accounting features
- `/admin/team` - Team management
- `/admin/settings` - Tenant settings
- `/admin/communications` - Communication features

### 2. **Sidebar Navigation Missing Items**
**Problem**: Stock and Communications not shown in tenant sidebar
**Fixed**: Updated `src/components/TenantAdminSidebar.tsx` to include:
- Stock management (with feature guard for `advanced_inventory`)
- Communications (with feature guard for `communication_features`)

### 3. **Domain-Based Tenant Resolution**
**Problem**: AuthContext didn't properly handle subdomain tenant resolution
**Fixed**: Enhanced `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to:
- Import and use `domainRouter` for domain-based tenant resolution
- Prioritize domain tenant ID over profile tenant ID on subdomains
- Auto-update user profiles with correct tenant context when on subdomains
- Handle fallback scenarios when profile data is missing

### 4. **Bank Transfer Dashboard Issue**
**Problem**: CashDrawerCard was querying wrong table for bank transfers
**Fixed**: Updated `src/components/CashDrawerCard.tsx` to:
- Query `transfer_requests` table instead of deprecated `cash_bank_transfer_requests`
- Filter by `transfer_type = 'account'` and `status = 'approved'` 
- Display bank transfers correctly in dashboard

## âœ… Verified Working Components

### Database Functions
- `get_tenant_by_domain()` - Resolves tenant ID from domain name
- `ensure_tenant_subdomain()` - Auto-creates subdomains for tenants
- All tenants have verified subdomains (*.vibenet.shop)

### Routing System  
- Main domain routes (vibenet.shop) - Landing page & superadmin
- Subdomain routes (tenant.vibenet.shop) - Full tenant functionality
- Custom domain support ready
- Proper fallback and redirect handling

### Authentication Context
- Domain-aware tenant resolution
- Proper role-based access control
- Subdomain-specific user context
- Automatic profile updates for domain context

### Navigation & UX
- All sidebar links use relative routing (React Router `Link`)
- Feature guards properly redirect to upgrade page
- No hardcoded absolute URLs that would break subdomains
- Consistent navigation experience across domains

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Domain Resolution Flow
1. `DomainRouter` parses current hostname
2. Identifies subdomain vs custom domain vs main domain
3. Resolves tenant ID from database via `get_tenant_by_domain()`
4. Sets up proper routing context

### Subdomain Routing
```
tenant-name.vibenet.shop/
â”œâ”€â”€ / (Dashboard)
â”œâ”€â”€ /admin/* (All tenant features)
â”œâ”€â”€ /profile (User profile)
â””â”€â”€ /auth (Authentication)
```

### Feature Protection
- Routes protected by `ProtectedRoute` component
- Features gated by `FeatureGuard` component  
- Subscription-based access control
- Graceful upgrade prompts for restricted features

## ðŸš€ Deployment Ready

The subdomain system is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Complete tenant functionality on subdomains
- âœ… Proper authentication and authorization
- âœ… Feature-based access control
- âœ… Bank transfer tracking fixed
- âœ… Consistent navigation experience
- âœ… Auto-subdomain creation for new tenants
- âœ… Scalable architecture for custom domains

All tenants can now access their full business management system via their dedicated subdomains.
